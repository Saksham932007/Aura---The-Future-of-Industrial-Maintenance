# Aura - The Future of Industrial Maintenance

## Vision

Aura is an intelligent predictive maintenance platform that empowers industrial operators to anticipate machine failures before they happen, preventing costly downtime and improving operational efficiency.

## Elevator Pitch

Machines talk, but are you listening? Aura is a smart, user-friendly platform that uses machine learning to translate real-time sensor data from industrial equipment into clear, actionable predictions. It alerts you to potential failures, identifies root causes, and helps you schedule maintenance proactively.

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the demo: `python run_demo.py`
3. Open browser to `http://localhost:5000`

## Demo Instructions

The demo will automatically:

1. Generate training data and train the ML model
2. Start the Flask backend API
3. Begin real-time data simulation
4. Serve the frontend dashboard

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Engine - Random Forest classifier with 85%+ accuracy

Watch as machine health scores change in real-time and alerts are generated when failures are predicted!
